Some considering\r\n      touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually\r\n      abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,\r\n      seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been\r\n      the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would\r\n      have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him\r\n      too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was\r\n      measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,\r\n      came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,\r\n      hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one\r\n      could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\r\n      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\r\n      insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab\r\n      then.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that\r\n      fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where\r\n      such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.—Down,\r\n      dog, and kennel!”\r\n     \n\r\n      Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\r\n      scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, “I\r\n      am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like\r\n      it, sir.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as\r\n      if to avoid some passionate temptation.\r\n    \n\r\n      “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be called a\r\n      dog, sir.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or\r\n      I’ll clear the world of thee!”\r\n     \n\r\n      As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in\r\n      his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\r\n    \n\r\n      “I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,” muttered\r\n      Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s very queer.\r\n      Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go back and strike\r\n      him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for him?\r\n      Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time\r\n      I ever did pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him\r\n      fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How\r\n      he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway\r\n      there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a\r\n      deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours\r\n      out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’t that Dough-Boy,\r\n      the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man’s\r\n      hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,\r\n      and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of\r\n      frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I\r\n      guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it’s a kind of\r\n      Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don’t\r\n      know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He’s full of\r\n      riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as\r\n      Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s that for, I should like to know?\r\n      Who’s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But\r\n      there’s no telling, it’s the old game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn\r\n      me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be born into the world, if only to fall\r\n      right asleep. And now that I think of it, that’s about the first thing\r\n      babies do, and that’s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are\r\n      queer, come to think of ’em. But that’s against my principles. Think not,\r\n      is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So\r\n      here goes again. But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he\r\n      called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that!\r\n      He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me,\r\n      and I didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.\r\n      It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I\r\n      don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of\r\n      turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though—How?\r\n      how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to hammock\r\n      again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over\r\n      by daylight.”\r\n     \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\r\n      CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.\r\n    \n\r\n      When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;\r\n      and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the\r\n      watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting\r\n      the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side\r\n      of the deck, he sat and smoked.\r\n    \n\r\n      In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\r\n      fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one\r\n      look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him\r\n      of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the\r\n      sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.\r\n    \n\r\n      Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in\r\n      quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How now,”\r\n       he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no longer\r\n      soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here\r\n      have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and\r\n      ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such\r\n      nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the\r\n      strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?\r\n      This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors\r\n      among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I’ll\r\n      smoke no more—”\r\n     \n\r\n      He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the\r\n      waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.\r\n      With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\r\n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\r\n      CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.\r\n    \n\r\n      Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory\r\n      leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,\r\n      upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!\r\n      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But\r\n      what was still more curious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams\r\n      are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be\r\n      thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that\r\n      kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not a real leg,\r\n      only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between a living thump\r\n      and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty\r\n      times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member—that\r\n      makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the\r\n      while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed\r\n      pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I\r\n      say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a\r\n      whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in\r\n      fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Besides,’\r\n      thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what\r\n      a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,\r\n      there’s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a\r\n      point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I\r\n      was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,\r\n      with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.\r\n      ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a\r\n      phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’\r\n      says I at last. ‘And what business is that of yours, I should like to\r\n      know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no\r\n      sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and\r\n      dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think, I\r\n      saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of\r\n      marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I\r\n      won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’ said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept\r\n      muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney\r\n      hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise\r\n      Stubb,’ I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I\r\n      had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that\r\n      kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I, ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye\r\n      here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t\r\n      he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right here it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he\r\n      used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says\r\n      he, ‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right\r\n      good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,\r\n      you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.\r\n      It’s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old\r\n      England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,\r\n      and made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked\r\n      by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by\r\n      him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can’t\r\n      help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’ With that, he all\r\n      of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the\r\n      air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do\r\n      you think of that dream, Flask?”\r\n     \n\r\n      “I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”\r\n     \n\r\n      “May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab\r\n      standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you\r\n      can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever\r\n      he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!\r\n    \n\r\n      “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\r\n    \n\r\n      “What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of\r\n      something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?\r\n      Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,\r\n      Flask. Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this\r\n      way.”\r\n     \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\r\n      CHAPTER 32. Cetology.\r\n    \n\r\n      Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in\r\n      its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the\r\n      Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the\r\n      leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost\r\n      indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special\r\n      leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.\r\n    \n\r\n      It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that\r\n      I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The\r\n      classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\r\n      essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.\r\n    \n\r\n      “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\r\n      Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\r\n    \n\r\n      “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as\r\n      to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * *\r\n      Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal” (sperm whale),\r\n      says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”\r\n       “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field strewn\r\n      with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us\r\n      naturalists.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,\r\n      those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real\r\n      knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some\r\n      small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men,\r\n      small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in\r\n      little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the\r\n      Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray;\r\n      Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;\r\n      Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;\r\n      John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of\r\n      Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate\r\n      generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will\r\n      show.\r\n    \n\r\n      Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever\r\n      saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer\r\n      and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the\r\n      Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby\r\n      knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with\r\n      which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it\r\n      said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.\r\n      He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the\r\n      long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some\r\n      seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown\r\n      sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all\r\n      but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been\r\n      every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in\r\n      the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,\r\n      without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has\r\n      at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good\r\n      people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm\r\n      whale now reigneth!\r\n    \n\r\n      There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living\r\n      sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree\r\n      succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s; both in\r\n      their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and\r\n      reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in\r\n      their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of\r\n      excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As\r\n      yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in\r\n      any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten\r\n      life.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive\r\n      classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to\r\n      be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man\r\n      advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor\r\n      endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to\r\n      be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not\r\n      pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or—in\r\n      this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is\r\n      simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the\r\n      architect, not the builder.\r\n    \n\r\n      But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office\r\n      is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to\r\n      have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis\r\n      of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to\r\n      hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well\r\n      appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the\r\n      hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through\r\n      oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in\r\n      earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.\r\n    \n\r\n      First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is\r\n      in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still\r\n      remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature,\r\n      A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from the\r\n      fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks\r\n      and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict, were\r\n      still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.\r\n    \n\r\n      The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from\r\n      the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular\r\n      heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\r\n      intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure\r\n      meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\r\n      Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they\r\n      united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\r\n      insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\r\n    \n\r\n      Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\r\n      ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This\r\n      fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect\r\n      does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given you those\r\n      items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all\r\n      other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\r\n    \n\r\n      Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\r\n      conspicuously to label him for all ti\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"24"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.
